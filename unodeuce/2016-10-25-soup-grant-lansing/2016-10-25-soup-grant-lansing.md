# SoupGrant Lansing

A hot bowl of soup is a great way to warm up and wind down on a crisp autumn day. But can't soup be enjoyed all year? Why not warm up your _soul_ as you warm up your body? And can the soup be _free_?

If you live in Lansing, you can enjoy all of this thanks to a spectacular event known as [SoupGrant Lansing][1]. Go grab a bowl and a spoon. When you get back, I'll fill you in on the details.

## SoupFunding

Think of SoupGrant Lansing as a crowdfunding event with free soup. On the third Thursday of every month, at [Grace Lutheran Church][2] in Lansing, people from in and around Lansing come together to enjoy great soup and support people doing good things in their community.

After some chit-chat with new friends, everyone settles in with a hot bowl of soup and watches 2-3 presenters discuss projects they are working on to improve the community.

## Community Boosting

Each presenter gets 5 minutes to describe their idea, how it helps people in Lansing, and how they would use the money from the _SoupGrant_. The crowd then has a chance to ask questions.

Once all of the pitches are done, anyone in the crowd who donates $5 or more gets to vote for their favorite project. The project that receives the most votes gets the whole pool of money donated by the voters, also known as the SoupGrant.

## Big Hearts Welcome

One aspect of SoupGrant Lansing that really stands out is its inclusiveness. _Anyone_ with an idea to improve their community can apply and present. High-schoolers, senior citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and everything in between are all welcome.

SoupGrant is also a great way to discover and support great, new things happening in Lansing. A **lot** of people are working very hard to make Lansing blossom and it's so inspiring to see a few of those folks each month.

## Get Involved
